         I walked in because I'm 38 and my doctor said I needed to exercise.
        </h1>
        <p>
          BJJ seemed strange and mysterious but I was also intrigued and thought it could be a fun way to make my visits to the doc less solemn affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I had no idea what I was getting myself into, I told myself that I'd check out a few academies before settling on one. That didn't happen. Carlson Gracie South Bay was the first one I visited...and the last. I just loved this crew here from the start. Andre is a great guy and an incredible professor who clearly loves to teach. The rest of the team was welcoming and generous with their knowledge. Everyone was happy to help this awkward new white belt learn to suck a little less with every class. No egos. No attitudes. No one looking to beat you down. Just good vibes and great training.

    <div class="faq__answer">
      Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art and combat sport based on ground fighting and submission holds.
